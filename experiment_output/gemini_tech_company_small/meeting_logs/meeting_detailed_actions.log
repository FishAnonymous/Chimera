I plan to start with a very basic AI, like a simple 'chase and attack' behavior.\n*   **Week 3:** Expand on the core mechanics by adding a basic resource system (e.g., health, mana, or stamina) and integrate it with the combat and movement systems. I also want to implement a simple UI to display these resources. Also maybe add some basic sound effects for the core mechanics.\n*   **Week 4:** Polish and refine the existing mechanics based on testing and feedback.
