Worker node 4947620624 (Clinical Lead-Nadia Silva),"As the Clinical Lead, I will identify the specific clinical workflows that will need to be modified or developed to capture influenza data within the EHR. This requires collaboration with clinical staff to understand current processes and identify integration points for new data collection steps.

1.  **Patient Registration/Intake:**
    *   **Modification:** Implement a standardized questionnaire during patient registration or intake to collect information on influenza vaccination status, prior influenza infections, and relevant risk factors. Integrate this questionnaire into the EHR workflow for easy access by registration staff. The responses will populate the relevant fields in the EHR.
2.  **Nursing Assessment:**
    *   **Modification:** Update the nursing assessment workflow to include a standardized assessment for influenza symptoms. This should include a checklist of common symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, fatigue) and a scale for symptom severity. Ensure that nurses are trained on how to properly document symptoms in the EHR using standardized terminology (e.g., SNOMED CT codes).
3.  **Physician Examination:**
    *   **Modification:** Modify the physician examination workflow to include prompts for influenza diagnosis and testing. Implement order sets for influenza testing (e.g., influenza A/B PCR) and antiviral medications. Ensure that physicians are aware of the current influenza guidelines and recommendations.
4.  **Laboratory Testing:**
    *   **Modification:** Ensure seamless integration between the EHR and the laboratory information system (LIS). Implement automatic result reporting from the LIS to the EHR. Develop a workflow for managing positive influenza test results, including automatic alerts to providers and public health agencies (if required).
5.  **Medication Ordering and Administration:**
    *   **Modification:** Integrate antiviral medication prescribing into the EHR workflow. Implement decision support tools to guide appropriate antiviral medication selection and dosing. Track medication administration in the EHR to monitor treatment effectiveness and identify potential adverse events.
6.  **Discharge Planning:**
    *   **Modification:** Update the discharge planning workflow to include patient education on influenza prevention and treatment. Provide patients with written instructions on how to manage their symptoms, prevent the spread of influenza, and seek medical care if needed. Document patient education in the EHR.
7. **Infection Control:**
    *   **Development:** Develop a workflow for infection control staff to monitor influenza cases and implement appropriate infection control measures. This may include tracking isolation precautions, monitoring staff vaccination rates, and investigating potential outbreaks.

8.  **Reporting and Analysis:**
    *   **Development:** Implement automated reports to track influenza trends, vaccination rates, and treatment outcomes. Ensure that these reports are easily accessible to clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health agencies. The data Reporting requirements defined by (Data Analysts - Mei Wong, Carlos Ramirez) will be referred to.
9. **Vaccination Clinics:**
    *   **Development:** Create a specific workflow within the EHR to support vaccination clinics. This workflow should facilitate efficient documentation of vaccinations, management of vaccine inventory, and reporting of vaccination data to public health agencies.

I will work with the IT Project Manager (Ricardo Alvarez), Physician Champion (Javier Rodriguez) , Training Coordinator (Samuel Dubois) and relevant clinical staff to implement these workflow modifications and ensure that they are integrated seamlessly into the EHR system.

Worker node 4962661184 (Registered Nurse-Liam OConnell),"As Registered Nurses (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson) and Clinical Lead (Nadia Silva), we will collaboratively plan workflow improvements for data entry to minimize errors in influenza data collection. This plan will focus on streamlining processes, enhancing usability, and reinforcing best practices.

1.  Workflow Analysis:
    *   Conduct a thorough analysis of the current data entry workflows for influenza-related data, observing nurses as they perform these tasks in real-time. (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
    *   Identify pain points, bottlenecks, and potential sources of error in the current workflows. (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
    *   Map out the ideal data entry workflow, incorporating best practices and minimizing unnecessary steps. (Nadia Silva)
2.  EHR System Optimization:
    *   Simplify data entry screens and forms, prioritizing essential data elements and minimizing clutter. (Nadia Silva)
    *   Implement user-friendly data entry tools, such as drop-down menus, check boxes, and pre-populated fields, to reduce manual typing and ensure data standardization. (Nadia Silva, working with EHR Integration Developers)
    *   Ensure consistent placement of key data fields across different screens and forms to improve usability and reduce the risk of errors. (Nadia Silva, working with EHR Integration Developers)
    *   Optimize the EHR system for mobile devices to allow for data entry at the point of care. (Nadia Silva, working with EHR Integration Developers)
3.  Real-Time Validation and Error Prevention:
    *   Implement real-time data validation rules within the EHR system to flag potential errors and inconsistencies as data is entered. (Nadia Silva, working with Quality Assurance Testers and EHR Integration Developers)
    *   Provide clear and informative error messages to guide users in correcting their mistakes. (Nadia Silva, working with Quality Assurance Testers and EHR Integration Developers)
    *   Implement range checks to ensure that data values fall within acceptable limits (e.g., temperature, age). (Nadia Silva, working with Quality Assurance Testers and EHR Integration Developers)
    *   Utilize “smart” fields that dynamically adjust based on previously entered data to prevent illogical entries. (Nadia Silva, working with EHR Integration Developers)
4.  Standardization and Training:
    *   Develop standardized data entry protocols and guidelines for all nursing staff involved in influenza data collection. (Nadia Silva, Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
    *   Provide comprehensive training to nursing staff on the new data entry workflows and data quality standards (in coordination with Samuel Dubois, Training Coordinator). (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
    *   Emphasize the importance of accurate and complete data collection for effective influenza surveillance and patient care. (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
    *   Create readily accessible job aids and quick reference guides to support staff in their daily work. (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson, working with Training Coordinator)
5.  Feedback and Iteration:
    *   Solicit regular feedback from nursing staff on the usability and effectiveness of the data entry workflows. (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
    *   Monitor data quality metrics (as defined in Subtask 15) to identify areas for improvement. (Nadia Silva)
    *   Iterate on the data entry workflows based on feedback and data quality monitoring results. (Nadia Silva, Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
    *   Establish a process for reporting and addressing data entry errors and system issues. (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
6.  Ergonomics and Workflow Environment:
    * Assess the physical workflow environment to ensure proper ergonomics. Consider screen placement, keyboard accessibility, and adequate lighting to minimize physical strain during data entry. (Liam OConnell, Priya Sharma, Aaliyah Johnson)
    * Ensure that nurses have sufficient time allocated for accurate data entry, recognizing that rushed data entry can lead to increased errors. (Nadia Silva, working with hospital administration)

By implementing these workflow improvements, we aim to create a more efficient, user-friendly, and error-resistant data entry process for influenza-related data, ultimately improving the quality and reliability of our data for surveillance and patient care."
