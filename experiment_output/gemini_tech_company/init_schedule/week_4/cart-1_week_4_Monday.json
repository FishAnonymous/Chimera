Since no specific goals were outlined in the meeting minutes for this week, I'll proactively reach out to @Ldes-1 (Lead Game Designer) and @Prod-1 (Producer) to clarify priorities. Email subject: 'Week 4 Concept Art Priorities'. Body: 'Hi [Lead Game Designer and Producer],\n\nI noticed that the meeting minutes didn't specify any concept art goals for this week. Could you please let me know what I should be focusing on? Are there any particular areas of the game that need visual exploration, or any existing concepts that need refinement?\n\nThanks,\nLeon.'"
