Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a plan for each employee for the next four weeks related to launching a market-neutral statistical arbitrage fund targeting UHNWIs under SEC regulations. I will leverage the results from Task 0 to generate detailed weekly goals for each employee, presented in a Pandas DataFrame-like format.

Here's the decomposed plan:

**1. Data Preparation and Structuring:**

*   **1.1 Extract Employee Data:** Extract employee IDs and roles from the provided dictionary.
*   **1.2 Create Base DataFrame Structure:** Create the structure for storing the results. This structure will have 20 rows (employees) and 5 columns ('Week1', 'Week2', 'Week3', 'Week4', and 'Employee').
*   **1.3 Populate Employee Column:** Fill the 'Employee' column with employee IDs.

**2. Goal Generation Based on Task 0 Results:**

*   **2.1 Iterate through Employees:**  Loop through each employee and determine their weekly goals.
*   **2.2 Map Roles to Task 0 Results:** Based on the employee's role, determine the relevant sub-task results from Task 0 that pertain to them. For example, the Data Scientists' goals will be influenced by the results of Task 0.4.
*   **2.3 Define Weekly Goals based on initial plan:**
    *   **Week 1:** Focus on initial research, planning, and preliminary framework development. These goals are based on Task 0.
    *   **Week 2:** Building upon Week 1, focus on refining the initial research and establishing concrete steps to implement the plans.
    *   **Week 3:**  Focus on more concrete tasks, building out the frameworks established in Weeks 1 and 2.
    *   **Week 4:** Focus on preparing for initial execution, finalize research and development, and align with external stakeholders.
*   **2.4 Populate DataFrame:**  Add the generated weekly goals for each employee into the appropriate cells of the DataFrame.

**3. Output Formatting:**

*   **3.1 Present Results:**  Format the generated plan for the next four weeks.

This code first creates a Pandas DataFrame and then populates it with the goals for each employee for each of the four weeks.  The goals are tailored to each employee's role based on the information in `Task 0`. Each goal is a string describing the intended activity for that week. Finally, the filled DataFrame is printed.
